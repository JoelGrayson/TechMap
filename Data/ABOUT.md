The most up-to-date list of companies is in the \*-wiki\* files because I deleted companies and nudged the LatLngs in those. So if you (me) geocode the companies again, they will not include these changes, so proceed with caution.

I only include Seattle, NY, and SF because those are the cities that have the most interesting companies.
I did not include Boston and Austin because there were not that many interesting companies that people would know about.
