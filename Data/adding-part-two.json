        "description": "This plaque marks the site of Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, founded in 1956 by William Shockley, co-inventor of the transistor. It was the first semiconductor company in Silicon Valley, setting the stage for the region’s tech boom. Internal tensions led eight engineers to leave and form Fairchild Semiconductor, sparking a wave of innovation and new startups. This moment is considered the catalyst for Silicon Valley’s entrepreneurial spirit and the modern tech industry."
