Ever visited Silicon Valley and wondered, "where are the tech companies located?" TechMap shows you a map of notable tech companies (like Instacart, Uber, LinkedIn, NVIDIA), a brief description about each, and lets you check off those that you visit so you can go tech company headquarters hopping! TechMap supports three regions: the Bay Area, NYC, and Seattle.
